# Boids
# What am I
bird-esque flocking system / simulation.

# How I work
In this simulation there is a world (class) that contains vehicle objects, each one of these vehicle objects posseses a position, velocity, and an acceleration varible; the velocity changes the position and the acceleration changes the velocity. What changes the acceleration? Well each vehicle or vehicle derived object has a set of behaviours it acts upon based on the world it occupies that change the velocity acordingly.

Boid. A boid is a vehicle derived object that acts bird-esque. It acomplishes this with 3 main behaviours. Cohestion. Alighnment. and Seperation.
